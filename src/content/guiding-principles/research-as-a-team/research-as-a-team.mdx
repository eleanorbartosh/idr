## Explorer or a Guide: Everyone plays a role

Everyone has a responsibility to champion for a better understanding of the end users. Each person on your team is either an Explorer or a Guide. Explorers bring domain and skills expertise and inform research objectives. Guides facilitate the collection, analysis, and production of research insights. They lead the team towards deeper user understanding. As a team, ask yourselves: “How do we make a difference for our users?”

### The Explorer

An Explorer has little or no applied research experience, but they participate in research activities and can help analyze data when appropriate. Explorers help identify the questions to answer based on their area of expertise.

#### Explorers ask themselves

- Where can my expertise help?
- How can I support a research activity?
- What questions do we have?
- How can I ask better questions in research?

Explorers can be developers, marketers, consultants, product owners, sales representatives, business analysts, other designers, and more. If you have yet to conduct design research in a professional setting or are just getting started in your career, you’re probably an Explorer.

#### Think like a tourist

When visiting a new place, you may seek to understand the local history and culture by immersing yourself in daily life or visiting popular attractions. The same approach can be applied to design research: Embrace a tourist-like mentality by becoming an active participant in the design research that occurs on your team.

#### Share expertise

As an Explorer, your super power is your domain expertise. When collaborating with your team, share your expertise with the Guides who are facilitating design research activities. This may mean participating in research analysis, accompanying the researcher on a site visit, or assisting in creating the research plan. The more you lean into the diverse skillsets and strengths of your team, the more successful you will be at fostering new ideas that improve your users’ experience.

#### Champion design research

Help secure the budget and resources needed to conduct quality research. Incorporate insights from research into your team's work.

### The Guide

Guides have deep design research experience and facilitate the practice across their team. They regularly curate questions and assumptions from their team, and identify methods and activities to prioritize and answer them. Guides craft and curate of insights to inform the creation of better user experiences.

#### Guides ask themselves:

- Who are the target user groups?
- How valid are our assumptions?
- How can I communicate insights?
- What can my team build now to advance our understanding?

Guides are often mid-career and beyond, with backgrounds that emphasize the study of people and human behavior. Some examples include social scientists, academic researchers, communications professionals, or designers.  If you have conducted human-centric research either professionally or academically for a number of years, you are most likely a Guide.

#### Think like a travel guide

Guides often make use of their experience, landmarks, and other tools to orient others along the journey. As a Guide, you will help your team discover things things they didn't know existed, and shepherd them through uncertainty. Guides need to resist the urge to work in isolation. Aim to work hand in hand with your team – just like a good host.

#### Promote expertise

Encourage colleagues with domain expertise to fill in the gaps of knowledge among more junior team members. Bring Explorers into research activities to provide new perspective. The more that team members participate in research, the faster they will internalize important findings.

#### Champion design research

It is your responsibility to uphold and support the design research produced on your team. Be aware of the research occurring around you and around the company. Be the voice of the user. Advise your team on what resources and tools are needed to support and produce quality design research, insights, and outcomes.
